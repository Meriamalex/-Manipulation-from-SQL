1. Training Impact on Departmental Performance
   Training has a mixed effect on departmental performance. Departments DPT001 and DPT002 show slight improvements (e.g., DPT001: 3.9167 to 3.9833; DPT002: 3.7833 to 3.8983), while DPT004 and DPT003 experience decreases (e.g., DPT004: 4.1163 to 3.9349; DPT003: 4.1837 to 3.8816).
   Action: Review the training programs for DPT004 and DPT003 to understand why performance declined. Assess the relevance, delivery, or content of the training and consider customizing it to address department-specific challenges.
2. Project Budget Efficiency
   Project costs per hour vary significantly. Data Migration is the most expensive at 2,682.2772 per hour (Total Budget: 11,871,759; Hours: 4,426), while Mobile App Development is the least costly at 2,382.4587 per hour (Total Budget: 16,391,316; Hours: 6,880).
   Action: Investigate the high costs of Data Migration. Determine if they result from project complexity, inefficiencies, or resource overuse. Use findings to optimize budgeting and resource allocation for future projects.
3. Attendance Consistency
   Attendance is stable across departments, with average days present around 20 (e.g., DPT003: 20.434, DPT002: 19.9138) and average days absent around 2.5 (e.g., DPT004: 2.2083, DPT001: 2.9268). The standard deviation for present days is consistent at approximately 3.
   Action: While attendance is reliable, introduce incentives or flexible work options to minimize absenteeism further and enhance productivity.
4. Employee Performance and Recognition
   All employees are rated "Excellent," reflecting strong performance. However, budget performance scores vary widely, from 498,258 (Hiran Sidhu, Data Migration) to 400,689 (Oorja Mahajan, Mobile App Development).
   Action: Recognize top performers like Hiran Sidhu to sustain motivation.
   Investigate lower scores (e.g., 400,689) to determine if they reflect project assignments or skill gaps. Provide targeted support or training to ensure consistent excellence.
